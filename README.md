# space-invaders-game

Tried making a copy of the retro-game called Space Invaders. Play it at https://ibtehajdoesdevelopment.on.drv.tw/webdev/games/space-invaders-game/.

This game requires a keyboard to play, hence the webpage is not responsive to fit mobile screen sizes.

This game was a part of the tutorial course given by Ania Kubow on the Free Code Camp YouTube channel.

Ideas on Improvement:

1. A spaceship should randomly appear and go across the screen, just as in the original game
2. Gradual shield damage
